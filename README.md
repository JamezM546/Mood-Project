# Mood-Project
Web application to write down and track moods/feelings.

Project Description:
The Mood Tracker is a simple web app for logging and visualizing daily moods. It uses JavaScript for basic interactivity and local storage to save user data, demonstrating fundamental client-side application development.

Key Features:
Mood Logging: Select a mood and add a note.
Mood History: View a chronological list of past entries.
Data Persistence: Saves data using localStorage so it remains after closing the browser.
Dynamic Updates: UI updates instantly without page reloads.
Responsive Design: Works well on mobile and desktop.


Technologies:
HTML5: Structure.
CSS3: Styling and responsiveness.
JavaScript (ES6+): All core logic (event handling, DOM manipulation, localStorage integration).
